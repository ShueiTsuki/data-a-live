 * active native4K context/tables with verified physical ownership/coherence,
 * and global fault-on-unmatched (no bypass). Global setup/quirks and context
 * creation belong to the platform; no global reset or mask probing occurs.
 * All target S2CRs must already fault; valid target SMRs must be exact matches.
 * Every other active SMR is checked for overlapping requested SIDs. No masked
 * attachment, bypass, privilege override, implicit slot selection or context
 * reassignment is supported. Reads actual ID0 and enabled context registers.
 * Inputs/state/result must be disjoint; state is zero-initialized and remains
 * exclusively owned. Configuration/tables remain immutable while attached.
 * Writes S2CR before publishing SMR; EXIDS keeps EXIDVALID clear until the
 * exact SMR has been read back. Success rereads actual context/stream state.
 * Any failure after a mutation attempt faults only the leased touched slots,
 * poisons state and forbids replay. Resources are retained on EVERY outcome.
 * Successful software I/O fixtures are not proof of active hardware tables. */
